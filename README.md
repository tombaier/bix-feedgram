# My first React TypeScript Application 

In order to get started with Web Development, I chose React and TypeScript for my first application. This GitHub project is a Social Media App, named FeedGram. 
As you maybe already recognized FeedGram is inspired by Instagram.\
This application is used to great a broader understanding of the fundamentals of React, TypeScript and Material UI. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
